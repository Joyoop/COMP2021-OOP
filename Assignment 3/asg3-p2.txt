Task 1:
    Compile!
    Result: "Thor is now a level 2 warrior."

Task 2:
    Doesn't Compile!
    Reason: Hero is a abstract class, which cannot be instantiated.

Task 3:
    Compile!
    Result: "Thor attacks Althea. Does 5 damage."

Task 4:
    Doesn't Compile!
    Reason: Healer and Warrior class are both subclass of abstract class Hero.
            Hence the type of these two would be different and incompatible.
            Therefore warrior object cannot be instantiated as Healer in this case.

Task 5:
    Compile!
    Result: "Thor attacks Thor. Does 5 damage."
            "Althea heals Althea by 0 points."

Task 6:
    Doesn't Compile!
    Reason: Warrior is a subclass of abstract class hero, which means hero
    could copy a warrior object but warrior could not copy a superclass object.
    The other way to say it is the two references, warrior and hero, get
    different static types, which are incompatible.
