1. "Variable v1 = new Variable(“a“);
    Build a new Class called "Variable" and its constructor
    takes one String instance as its name.

2. Expr b4 = new BinaryExpr(b2, v1, BinaryOp.DIVIDE);
    Build a new abstract class called "Expr" and make
    both "BinaryExpr" and "Literal" class extending it.
    Also make "Variable" class extend "Literal" class
    so that it could be token as an instance for
    "BinaryExpr" constructor.

3. Environment env = new Environment();
    Build a new class called "Environment".

4. env.addVariable(“a“, 2.0);
    Add a method in "Environment" class which
    takes two parameters, String "Name" and
    double "Value", while returning "value".

5. System.out.println(b4.evaluate());
    Add a abstract method "evaluate" which takes
    no parameters and throw RunTimeException

6. System.out.println(b4.evaluate(env));
    Add a abstract medthod "evaluate" which takes
    one parameter "env" whose type is "Environment".

    Override this method in class "Literal" which
    does nothing.

    Override this method in class "BinaryExpr"
    which build a new BinaryExpr object taking
    the original first and last parameter but
    retrieves only double value from "Variable"
    parameter as its second parameter. Return the
    evaluate() result of this new "BinaryExpr"
    Object.
